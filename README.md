The brief:
----------

We would like you to build a pairing organiser for a cohort of Makers' students. We'll get you started with a few user stories:

```
As a maker
I want to be paired with someone
So that I can learn faster

As a bewildered maker
I want to see a list of everyone in my cohort
So that I know who these weird people are

As a promiscuous maker
I want to see a sorted list of people in my cohort that I have/have not paired with
So that I can keep pairing with more people

As a shy maker  
I want a pair partner to be randomly assigned to me  
So that I donâ€™t have to ask them  

As an unfriendly maker  
I want to have a blacklist of students I will never be paired with  
So that I never have to listen to them speak
```
