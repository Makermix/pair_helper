#Pair Buddy
-----------


The brief:
----------

We would like you to build a pairing organiser for a cohort of Makers' students. We'll get you started with a few user stories:

```
As a maker
I want to be paired with someone
So that I can learn faster

As a bewildered maker
I want to see a list of everyone in my cohort
So that I know who these weird people are

As a promiscuous maker
I want to see a sorted list of people in my cohort that I have/have not paired with
So that I can keep pairing with more people

As a shy maker  
I want a pair partner to be randomly assigned to me  
So that I donâ€™t have to ask them  

As an unfriendly maker  
I want to have a blacklist of students I will never be paired with  
So that I never have to listen to them speak
```

Optional

```
As a security-conscious maker
I want to be able to log in with a password
So that nobody can see my lists

As a lazy security-conscious maker
I want to sign in through github
So that I don't have to remember another password

As a curious maker
I want to see other students' github commit history
So that I can compare my progress to theirs

As a maker with many commits
I want to be preferentially paired with someone who has fewer commits
So that I can accelerate our learning by pairing together
```
